# 2klauncher-bypasser
A simple DLL to bypass 2K Launcher in Epic Store and Steam

# How to use
1. Drop the DLL into the 2KLauncher folder of the game (alongside LauncherPatcher.exe)
2. Create cfg.txt in the same folder where you dropped the DLL, on the first line write down the absolute path to the actual game exe (different for every game, for example for BioShock Infinite it would be smth like C:\Program Files\Epic\Library\BioshockInfiniteCompleteEdition\Binaries\Win32\ShippingPC-XGame.exe)
3. Optionally, if using Epic Store, you can override the game locale by writing the two-letter locale identifier on the second line
4. Launch the game through the Steam/Epic Store launcher as intended
5. Enjoy!
